		        	<p>Online ordering is already widespread and continues to increase in volume across the industry. If you donâ€™t offer online ordering - for takeout and/or delivery - you may be missing out on a huge additional revenue stream. And if you do offer online ordering, make it easy for customers to find it on your website and how you'd prefer they order food from you.If you've already got a customer on your website, take advantage of that and let them order online, straight from you. They prominently display a button at the top of their website to let visitors easily place an order. Alternately, some restaurants choose to provide links to whichever online ordering sites they use to dispatch food to customers' homes.</p>
